This is a demo app for Firefox OS, which will show you available flights available, in your region, from point A to point B.
At this time, the application is not finished yet, only the geolocation part is done (using google services to find  the A and B coordinates and HTML5 geolocation).

This project was done by the nyxpoint dev team, http://www.nyxpoint.com.
